<!--  <h6>Hand crafted by <a href="/about">Michael Boeke</a> on March  7, 2013</h6> -->
  <p>I’m going to explore more mobile UI antipatterns, starting with what I call “hinting instead of acting”. This is when a UI hints at the proper action a user should have taken, rather than just doing what the user expects.</p>

<p><img alt='Google Maps on iOS' src='/images/blog/iOS_Google_maps.png' /></p>

<p>I love the Google Maps app on iOS (huzzah for public transit directions!), but it employed this antipattern when it launched. When you touched a pin on the map, it caused the bottom of the screen to bounce, hinting that you should swipe upwards to get directions and other options. Why not just open the panel when a user touches the pin?

<!--  <h6>Hand crafted by <a href="/about">Michael Boeke</a> on February 20, 2013</h6> -->
  <p>I’m currently reading Jonathon Haidt’s <a href='http://www.amazon.com/The-Righteous-Mind-Politics-ebook/dp/B0052FF7YM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361423547&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+righteous+mind'><em>The Righteous Mind</em></a>. It’s a book about morality and politics, but it is challenging some of my long-held conceptions about the design process, particularly critiques.</p>

<p>In the first segment of the book, Haidt makes a compelling argument that judgement and justification are two separate processes. Judgment is immediate and intuitive, and whether we choose to believe it, justification comes only after we’ve made our intuitive response to something. As he states it succinctly Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second.</p>

<p>This has some pretty profound implications for design critique. No matter how much we try to rationally analyze whether a design solves a given problem, we are actually going to judge it first on an intuitive level. When we analyze it’s effectiveness, we will inevitably come up with reasons that justify our our initial intuitive reaction.

  <h3><a href="/blog/2012/12/20/What-is-a-UI-antipattern.html">What is a UI antipattern?</a></h3>
<!--  <h6>Hand crafted by <a href="/about">Michael Boeke</a> on December 20, 2012</h6> -->
  <p>I kicked off this series of posts without really delving into what qualifies as a UI antipattern. I was talking about my UI antipatterns posts with a couple of developer friends at Braintree, and one commented that “it’s fun to point out when people are doing it wrong online”. I wouldn’t disagree, but just because some site is doing it wrong, doesn’t mean it’s an antipattern. Sometimes it’s just crappy design, or total lack of design.</p>

<p><img alt='Mosaic pattern' src='/images/blog/pattern.jpg' /></p>

<p>To qualify as an antipattern, it has to be a repeated pattern that appears to be beneficial at first, but turns out to create more unintended problems. Additionally, a better answer to the problem has to exist and be documentable and repeatable.

<!--  <h6>Hand crafted by <a href="/about">Michael Boeke</a> on December 12, 2012</h6> -->
  <p>This is an antipattern I’ve come across many times while working on financial software. It often occurs when a website is trying to present one form that will map to multiple systems, or will be used to replicate a physical form (e.g. a credit application). Few things are more frustrating to a user than having to fill out the same data multiple times. It adds no value, increases the likelihood of error, and causes people to tear their hair out.</p>

<p>For example, let’s take a look at the <a href='http://www.active.com/framed/event_detail.cfm?EVENT_ID=2066969&amp;RESET=0&amp;CHECKSSO=0'><em>Active.com signup for the Shamrock Shuffle</em></a> (a great springtime running race in Chicago). It starts off with just a few questions about my age. Thankfully, it calculates my age for me, based on my birthdate, but it won’t infer that I’m older than 16.</p>

<!--  <h6>Hand crafted by <a href="/about">Michael Boeke</a> on November 28, 2012</h6> -->
  <p>When collecting a US phone number on a web form, it has become convention to collect it with three separate fields. This is meant to help the user successfully input the number in the format the server will accept. Since the user may think of the phone number as one piece of data, rather than three distinct items, many sites employ a feature that jumps the cursor to the next field as soon as it is filled with the expected numbers of characters.</p>

<p><img alt='Split phone number' src='/images/blog/split_numbers1.png' /></p>

<p>This will totally screw up a user like me, who is used to powering through web forms by hammering the tab key as soon as I complete a field. Which leads to the unfortunate situation illustrated below.</p>

<p>The good folks at Southwest Airlines have tried to help me by moving my cursor to the second field in the phone number, but I’ve already hit the tab key. So I’ve skipped the second field entirely and gone straight to the third. Doh. Hence, an antipattern.
