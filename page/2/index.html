  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/11/28/ui-antipatterns-splitting-numbers/">UI Antipatterns: Splitting Numbers</a></h2>
  <p>When collecting a US phone number on a web form, it has become convention to collect it with three separate fields. This is meant to help the user successfully input the number in the format the server will accept. Since the user may think of the phone number as one piece of data, rather than three distinct items, many sites employ a feature that jumps the cursor to the next field as soon as it is filled with the expected numbers of characters.</p>
<img alt='Split phone number' class='blog-image' src='/images/blog/split_numbers1.png' />
<p>This will totally screw up a user like me, who is used to powering through web forms by hammering the tab key as soon as I complete a field. Which leads to the unfortunate situation illustrated below.</p>

<p>The good folks at Southwest Airlines have tried to help me by moving my cursor to the second field in the phone number, but I’ve already hit the tab key. So I’ve skipped the second field entirely and gone straight to the third. Doh. Hence, an antipattern.

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/11/01/sales-timelines-explained-for-geeks/">Sales Timelines Explained for Geeks</a></h2>
  <p>When we were first starting up Backstop, we would watch eagerly as each new customer advanced through the sales pipeline, and tear our hair out as deals seemed to drag on forever. Years later, I still hear the development teams I work with at Braintree asking ”when will deal X be done?” So, I thought it might be useful to write down this explanation I came up with for that early Backstop dev team.</p>

<p>The best way for a geek to understand the situation is to think about the deal as an entity with a dual quantum nature, similar to light. It possess both the linear characteristics of a wave and some decidedly non-linear characteristics that suggest a particle nature.</p>

<p>In the early or middle phases of deal negotiation, things progress along a fairly linear and predictable path. All parties involved agree that they are headed for completion at a reasonably forseeable date.

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/09/16/how-to-get-designers-to-make-your-open-source-project-awesome/">How to get designers to make your open source project awesome</a></h2>
  <p>Like many designers, I use open source software, believe in the open source ethos, and would love to help make open source software look better and be easier to use. A lot of open-source projects are focused on the back-end, and don’t require a ton of UI/UX design, but it seems that there are more web apps popping up these days.</p>

<p>I had the good fortune to get involved with the Brainiac project recently, and wanted to share some of the hurdles I faced as a designer getting involved in the project. If you can address these things on your open source project, you stand a much better chance of getting designers and front-end developers to contribute.

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/07/31/ui-anti-patterns-mixing-status-and-action/">UI Anti-patterns: mixing status and action</a></h2>
  <p>One of the things I’d like to explore on this blog are some of the common UI anti-patterns I see while designing software.</p>

<p>For example take a look at this picture from the very cool Jukebox 2 open source project. At a glance, it looks like most of the accounts are disabled.</p>
<img alt='Jukebox users table' class='blog-image' src='/images/blog/users.png' />
<p>Surprise! The reverse is actually true. The problem is that the UI control for disabling an account seems to be displaying its state. This is totally confusing for the viewer, because it’s actually showing the state the account will be in once the users clicks the button.

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/06/13/design-is-life-or-death/">Design is Life or Death</a></h2>
  <p>As I was out running the other day, I saw a sandwich board propped up in the middle of the road that read “Car Wash for Food Pantry”. The message was written in large, outlined, bubble letters, and I squinted to read it from just a couple of car-lengths away.</p>

<p>My design instinct immediately kicked in, as I determined that none of the cars on the road could read this sign in time to make a decision about whether to stop at the car wash. It was obvious that they should fill in the bubble letters, and make them much darker. I next realized that this bad design decision was probably impacting how much money they would raise, and given the cause, it might mean that some family would go hungry.
